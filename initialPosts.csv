The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
In a beautiful pea-green boat:
They took some honey,
and plenty of money
Wrapped up in a five-pound note.

The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar,
""O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are!
What a beautiful Pussy you are!""

Pussy said to the Owl, ""You elegant fowl,
How charmingly sweet you sing!
Oh! let us be married;
too long we have tarried:
But what shall we do for a ring?""

They sailed away, for a year and a day,
To the land where the bong-tree grows;
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood,
With a ring at the end of his nose,
His nose,
His nose,
With a ring at the end of his nose.

""Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
Your ring?"" Said the Piggy, ""I will.""
So they took it away, and were married next day
By the Turkey who lives on the hill.

They dined on mince and slices of quince,
Which they ate with a runcible spoon;
And hand in hand on the edge of the sand
They danced by the light of the moon,
The moon,
The moon,
They danced by the light of the moon."

Then I noticed that vendors give me the same price for some products as I have at auctions. So I asked myself: what for should I pay listing and comission fees and lose a lot of currants. 
It is really unprofitable with some things like meat and hooch and sparkly. etc.

Because of this, I'm obviously not using my herb plots, so I'm going to give a try at renting out my place for the time being. I've decided that I probably won't be able to really play until about mid- March, so for anyone's who's interested please let me know so we can go over exact dates, do the friend requests so you can get your key as soon as possible.

My house is located in the 1200 block in Nia Sra. It's just a small walk from the Jutuan Central Subway Station In Chakra Phool if you prefer or cannot teleport.

Now as for payment... personally I'm open to suggestions based on what you're comfortable with

My own suggestions would be FOOD AND DRINK! <3
My glitch especially loves, Rich Tagine and Ix-Style Braised Beef pretty easy dishes since most of the ingredients can be gathered from the land.
As for Drinks anything's fine honestly buffs or no buffs, replenishing mood is all I'm concerned about for that.

If you're not the cooking kind of Glitch then currants or rocks of all kinds are great too!"

(look inside),"So I'm not having a whole lot of luck selling my semi-rare cubimals outright. So I want to auction them off - starting at VERY low prices. And no reserve! If you're the high bidder at the end of the auction, even if it's only 500c, you win!

How It Will Work

Below is a list of the cubimals up for auction, numbered and listed with a minimum opening bid. Please format your bids like this:

 Cubi #1 - 1000c (or whatever your bid is)

Keep the increments to 100 for nice round numbers. :)

Here's the inventory: (current high bidder and current price in parentheses)

1. Juju - starting bid 800c (sir rachel 1400c)
2. Juju - starting bid 800c (AndreaB 900c)
3. Juju - starting bid 800c (diaveborn 800c)
4. Squid - starting bid 800c (AndreaB 900c)
5. Squid - starting bid 800c (diaveborn 800c)
6. Squid - starting bid 800c (sir rachel 1400c)
7. Snocone - starting bid 500c (diaveborn 700c)
8. Snocone - starting bid 500c (AndreaB 700c)
9. Cactus - starting bid 500c (AndreaB 700c)
10. Cactus - starting bid 500c (sir rachel 1600c)
11. Bureaucrat - starting bid 1000c (diaveborn 1000c)
12. Deimaginator - starting bid 1000c (Kimmy Whimmy 1500c)

The highest bidder at 11:59pm Central Standard Time on January 16, 2012 will be the winner! I will contact winners the next day on January 17. Keep them, sell them, drop them in Marylpole Mount... I don't care. They'll be all yours to do with what you like!

I'll edit the original post with high bidders as I have time, so nobody has to scroll through and figure out what the high bid is for any given cubi.

Good luck and happy bidding!"

If you have one emblem for each of the giants, then you can sign-up for the giant whose icon you would like.  Once the round is closed, just submit your set of 11 emblems and receive your icon in return.  There are NO ADDITIONAL COSTS involved in this process, no charges or hidden fees.  (Though if you are mailing your emblems to the round organizer, you are responsible for the postage charges to send them your emblems).

This way, you do not have to wait until you have 11 emblems from the same giant--you can have your icons NOW!

There are currently two rounds open.  This one is the closest to completion, with Icons for Lem and Zille still available: www.glitch.com/groups/RIFLA...

But wait, you say, I want the ""Giant Lover"" achievement.  Well, come get acquainted with the Emblem Trading, Icon Creation group.  Once you make contacts there, you can ask to host your own round, and get the achievement that way.  

So, come on down and claim your icon now!"

b) All transactions can be trade or purchased in currants. 
c) To start a transaction please use the in game ""Trade"" menu option on the player menu (this will help avoid any confusion in the chats). 
d) The trading parties will barter and settle on what they believe to be a fair trade or price. If they can not come to an agreement, then please cancel the trade.

I have extras, no need for so many doubles and would like to earn a tiny bit of what I spent back.

I have:
2 crabs for free

7 frogs for 500 each
3 cacti (cactuses) for 2000 each
1 bureaucrat for 3000
1 sno cone vendor for 3000
3 deimaginators for 3000 each
2 jujus for 3000 each

I'll also be roaming around in game in chakra phool dropping piggies, chicks, crabs, batterflies, butterflies and whatever else I didn't think was worth asking currents for.  I'm happy to mail a couple crabs and pay for the mailing fee but would prefer not to pay for the gazillion other unrares as there are a ton!  So, near Aava Plies and the surrounding streets, if you are there, have a look.

b) All transactions can be trade or purchased in currants. 
c) To start a transaction please use the in game ""Trade"" menu option on the player menu (this will help avoid any confusion in the chats). 
d) The trading parties will barter and settle on what they believe to be a fair trade or price. If they can not come to an agreement, then please cancel the trade. 
e) Feel free to announce your goods and location in the chats.

So, glitchies, I decided to lower the price for my GNG music block by unbelievable 50%:

I will now trade it away...
- ... either for 400K 
- ... or for rube cubi

I'll also make sort of a drawing out of that. Please post a comment here if you want to trade!
Tomorrow afternoon (CET, that is about 7 a.m. Pacific Time), I'm gonna draw one of you!

(OK, it's not a real Giveaway. But I'm not in the position yet to give away something that big...)


Newbie info: A big difference between the GNG and the other  music blocks is, that if  you play it you will hear a full length song,  sung by a beautiful  feminine voice. ""Good Night Groddle"" is a  beautiful lullaby-ish song that was played in the ancient times of the  first Glitch Beta phase shortly before the game closed for further  development works. That is, when you heard this song sounding all over  Ur it was always SO sad because you knew in a few seconds the game would  close for a mostly unknown amount of time, which sometimes meant  several weeks of painful waiting! 
So - you should really consider investing something to get that real Glitch Nostalgia Feeling in your jukebox!"

I love stew, I have a pile of emblems, and I have a donating habit that keeps getting me more emblems than I need as I try to get up to level 60. Help me, help yourself, save time and currants by trading. I can often be found in Cebarkul offering exactly these deals. 

By Grabthar's hammer, what a savings.

I have 8 Friendly, 7 Pot, 6 Grendaline, and 3 or more of every other emblem.

If you want to pay currants rather than stew, give me 4 k for one or 3.5 k each for 2 or more, mix and match, your choice. They are going fast."

This is the current map of Grand Circuit:
http://imgur.com/fYCrq 

As you can see, we have quite a few connected houses now, and more are on the way. I'm now thinking it would be a great time to get anyone who runs a business or service to put their houses on Grand Circuit, and possibly set their house up to reflect that business or service. Run a day spa? How about a restaurant? Clever use of wallpaper, furniture and the place command from inventory can keep all your things safe from theft while you gleefully perform your service for your paying customers! 

Even if you don't run your service or business from inside your house, you may still want it listed just so other players know to track you down! Sell a lot of cubimals but don't want to actively harass people for em? USB provides a way for your customers to find you!

This is where the discussion is going to occur (thread is in the Grand Circuit of Houses of Ur Group):
http://www.glitch.com/groups/RIFFLR6CTSP266I/discuss/9886/

Note that listing a business for now will either require a free demo or 100 currant fee. The free demo lets me see that you actually have a ""something"" that you're doing, before adding it to the map. The currant fee is an alternative that shows your interest in participating if you don't yet have something to show. I am also offering for 500 currants the ability to request a simple symbol that I'll place next to your house on the map as a logo. Unlike the majority of the items on the map these symbols will be unique, hence the cost. However, some free, non-unique symbols will be getting made too, so you might want to wait a bit ;).

Note that if you've joined Grand your house appears on the map even if you have no business or service you're offering."

It doesn't matter to me that much, though mining has become a lot less full of wallop lately...slowing my collecting--but if anybody is still selling at the tool vendor, you might consider getting at least 200 currants more per diamond.  

Other gems still seem to be about the same but I haven't seen diamonds for under 2000, right now 2375--seems absurd unless they really did nerf diamonds from mining.  Which they denied when last I asked about it."

I was wondering if anyone with a Rube cubi would allow me to hold it just long enough to get the cubimal collection trophy?  I will give it back immediately.  I'm not going to be able to devote enough in-game time to raise the funds to buy a Rube (and I doubt I'll get lucky enough to get it within a couple random cubimal box purchases like my Rook, haha), and I'd just like to get the trophy so I can take my time saving up for a Rube even if we get fox and/or sloth and/or ranger cubimals before I can afford one :)

I'll be in game in about half an hour (12ish EST) and will be on for about an hour.  If anyone would like to help me out, I'd greatly appreciate it :)

I'm interested in buying a Dusty Stick

I like to collect rare items just as a collecter (as I am also in real life) and have no intention of selling it on. Taking a look at the other offers I think mine is quite fair. I'd be willing to buy one for 1,000,000 Currants and 800 credits worth of furniture upgrades. (with the prices i'm seeing that don't seem to be going down, if you were to sell on the furniture upgrades that would be worth well over 1,000,000 currants also). I would be able to offer every cubimal except the Rook and Rube but if you want those i'll try and get my hands on those.

If anybody is interested I won't be able to make the trade during the week as I am on a dongle and will have a secure and strong connection on the weekend.

Thanks

Dylan"

-you must provide me with snails (8 per box) and fuel, I need 2 fuel cells* for every 5 boxes
-priority will go to those who do not have furniture making skills
-I will make a maximum of 20 boxes per person but may only offer 10 per person if I get flooded with requests 
-if you provide me with chunks of metal, tin ingots and plain ingots or boards I will sell it to you for 500c 
-I will also gladly accept food to compensate for the energy lost from construction! 

I know there are not usually rules for sales but most SDBs are going for 4k each and this is a super good deal and I need to create these rules to make it work. 

*If you cannot provide fuel cells because you do not have the skill to make them (I don't want you to have to buy them from the auctions), please provide me with the resources I need to make fuel. 

If you do not want to provide resources or wait, please contact Gersandai and he can make you SDBs as well.

Market! Market! It's time for a Market!

Click here for info on the next market

PLEASE! All types of vendors are welcome! If you sell potions, furniture, musicblocks, ANYTHING, come! 

Never Been to a Market? New to the Group?
Here's how the Markets work:
a) Independent vendors or stores can set up an area for selling or bartering their goods. Bring a sheet of paper and list what you are selling or trading for and drop it on the ground next to you.b) All transactions can be trade or purchased in currants. c) To start a transaction please use the in game ""Trade"" menu option on the player menu (this will help avoid any confusion in the chats). d) The trading parties will barter and settle on what they believe to be a fair trade or price. If they can not come to an agreement, then please cancel the trade. e) Feel free to announce your goods and location in the chats. 

There will be a platform with free food and hooch. If anyone would like to volunteer to cook, feel free to do so. I already have the hooch, but if anyone doesn't volunteer to do food I'll gladly do so myself. 

Sorry for the inconvenience, but do to some RL obligations I will not be able to coordinate a market for this upcoming saturday, but we will have one on Wednesday and Saturday of next week. 

If you can't make them all, please don't miss em all!

Looking forward to seeing you there!

I responded to her thread offering 1 million currants for a Senor Fun Pickle. And then mails started coming in with lots of offers. So I guess I didn't really think this through. Again, I apologise.

I've been thinking about a fair way to sell Senor Fun Pickle and the only thing I can come up with, which I hope is fair to everybody who wants the chance to buy one, to Mermaid and to myself, is the following:

Please mail me your offer. Don't post here on the thread as I'd like to avoid an 'auction'. My preference would be to just receive an offer in currants as I have almost everything else. I will post the highest offer here on this thread in 24 hours (let's do this quick and dirty before I change my mind). If the highest offer is not made by Mermaid, I am going to give Mermaid the chance to match the highest offer. If she can match, she will get Senor Fun Pickle. If she can't match, the highest bidder will get the Pickle. If I receive two equal offers, it's first come first served. In any event, the Pickle will change hands in 24 hrs.

In the spirit of fairness, I think I should also tell you that the highest offer I have received so far is 1.5 million currants. That will be the last offer I disclose. I know this system isn't ideal but I hope it gives everyone a chance without going into an 'auction' that could potentially be drawn out over a long period of time.

Take care & hugs!

I hope to sell furniture to people who want to actually use it, not people who are going to resell it. Most of the furniture I make should be cheaper than is on the auction, as I'm charging the cost of all the materials and resources x 1.5.

For more detailed information, you can visit this group that I've started. I've listed a few discounts on the group page, so check that out if you want to get as much as 45% off your purchase.

Disclaimer: I have 0 actual furniture in stock, so anyone who is interested may have to wait for up to 24 hours.
The prices that I specified above are not set, and may change depending on how expensive the raw materials become.

Post here or contact me or somethin' if you're interested. Oh, and join the group if you are further-ly interested in my services. Thanks for reading."

I have a Cubimal mountain I'd kind of like to clear before it gets an east face. Maybe snow. Also, yaks. So if anyone is interested in any of the below, make an offer. Preferably a realistic one, but I have no idea what Cubimals go for so, you know. 

I've included unrares because unrares need love too. Piggy mountain: you know it makes sense."

This is the quickest and easiest way to get your quest AND your achievement badge at the same time!

Quest-
Loyalty's Rich Reward
Collect eleven Emblems of one Giant and iconize them to create a Giant's Icon.

Achievement Badge-
Giant Lover - Created an icon for every Giant

I'm asking 300k for 12 emblems of each giant in 12 bigger bags of varying colors.

What you get for your currants:

Well mine are going for less than 50% cheaper than the auctions.

Welcome to Monday Funday.

You pay a one time fee of 12k, and for 6 weeks straight, you will receive a wall segment every monday.
When the 6 weeks is up, you can choose to renew for 8k, and continue another 6 weeks, or you can choose to stop receiving.

When you sign up, and deposit the 12k, you'll receive a segment immediately. Then every monday after that, you'll receive one.

You only pay once. (Unless you choose to renew).

If I fail to send you a segment on a monday within that 6 week period, you must message me to remind me. If you have to remind me, I will send 2 segments that day to make up for the inconvenience.

Auction Prices
Wall segment- 5k
so 6 wall segments would be 30k

My prices
Wall Segment- 1714
so you get 7 wall segments for 12k. 

Thats a deal.

Now, we could sell them on auction, but the process is slow, and the 7% fee quite high for expensive furniture. 

The alternative is to swap them directly with each other. However, it's hard to find people to swap with. So, as a start, why not let's all list what furniture we can trade, and see if there are any takers for them. You can contact me or anybody else on this thread privately, but of course both sides must agree to the trade. Here's what I have: 

Glass Candle Centerpiece - Tabletop decoration, 15 credits
Wooden Lazy Chair with Dot Cushions - Armchair, 15 credits 
Coral Armchair - Armchair, 15 credits

One of my friends just completed the quest and found the heart so disturbing she just wanted to get rid of it. She wanted nothing in return, but in my view it's an odd sort of rare object. Usually I'd just add it to my collection, but it feels weird to do that this time. I don't think my friend understands that this item has value. So I'd like to sell it and then offer her the money. She doesn't know I'm doing this, so if it turns out no one wants it, that's okay, too.

NOTE: Since handling the Faded Heart before completing the quest will screw up the quest, I'm only willing to sell this to someone who has already completed the quest or who already has another Faded Heart in her or his possession.

I will be happy to traverse the world collecting resources for you or performing your menial chores such as mining, sloth feeding, fox brushing and harvesting. (At this time I do not have the skills to refill feeders or collect from collectors but I am working on it). I am already wandering around completing my own tasks so adding your errands to my own list will be no big deal. The cost for this will be as follows:
Gathering resources from trees, pigs, chickens, jellis, or barnacles: 5c per item so 250 cherries=1250c
Mining, food items= 25c per item plus 250c for energy loss so 50 metal=1500c
Fox brushing=200c per action (3 brushes) so whatever I can brush within 3 brushes=200c
Sloth feeding=1500c per rod feeding; if you provide rods then reduced to 1000c

For questions about this service either mail message me or post here. I believe these prices are fair and in keeping with auction pricing. If you are interested in this service please message mail me so I have record of the ""purchase order"". I should be able to fufill the order within a day or so.

You may support the project by purchasing a reasonably priced stage light.  I've got floor kliegs and standing spot lights, all in matte black finish.  Also, a delicate rook floor lamp (nest included), marked-to-sell blue Uralia lamps and even a ham-bone!  I know, who knew you could light an entire room with leg of ham?

Bog stylings are still available although many are already sold out, as usual.  My prices are fair, either exactly the amount of currants if you were to have your own furniture upgraded (1000c per credit) or just a few hundred currants over.  It's almost as if the furniture is free and all you are paying for is the credit upgrade!

Check it out, you may find something you like!

Keep in mind, for next month's stipend, I'll be making fancy dangling firefly jar lights that you affix to the ceiling.  They make any room something special and romantic!  A subtle breeze will cause these lights to sparkle and chime--delightful!

****QUICK explanation- post (here) how much you would pay for a set and outbid as many people as possible-if you win you'll get to buy them for that price GO***

Detailed explanation:
This is how this will work: I am currently selling only 12 more (I have 13 but have yet to decide if I will want to keep a set for myself or not,)
I only made 16 sets- so these are rather unique,
I have a minimum price in my head and reserve the right to decrease or increase the number I am selling based on the bid price- not as if you are giving me the money up front anyway.

The highest 12 bids (or fewer RE: above) will get to come to my tower and buy the sdb at the price agreed upon (purchasing from the wall so that you know you are getting the real deal)
In cases of ties the oldest bid will win

Much Ghostbusting and trapping research has been done to ensure that unless TS changes things you will be able to purchase these trapped ghosts- as well as safeley contain them indefinitly.
Bidding will be open until at least sunday 8pm EST

You are bidding at the price you will pay for a set of 5 (one of each lantern)

***REVISION- the minimum price is 50K for a set, think about it like this, there are upgraded SDB that go for 25K, these are similarly decorative and unlike upgraded sdb are currently LIMITED in supply-please bid accordingly and politely***"

I have more credits then I can spend so why not make some furniture upgrades for my fellow Glitchen? Here's the deal:

- 1k per credit
- find me in game, give me your basic piece of furniture, I'll upgrade and trade it back for currants
- or: send the piece of furniture in the mail, add the currants and a message telling me what upgrade you want. I promise not to scam you.

Don't have the furniture making skills yourself? Bring me the materials and some food to restore my energy and I'll make it for you, free of charge.

Have you always wondered what it would be like to work under a perfectionistic, self-important, easily-distracted procrastinator for nothing more than the pervasive sense of personal dissatisfaction that comes from being overworked, under-appreciated, and totally taken for granted?

Well now’s your big chance! The ""Where’s Bruce?"" Project needs YOU!

Example  ̶M̶i̶n̶i̶o̶n̶  Assistant Duties:
• providing encouragement and semi-believable flattery to me on a regular basis
• compiling lists of participants
• determining which participants appeared with S-items, and who appeared with which ones first
• double-checking participant list and location snapshot entries against final image to make sure no one was overlooked
• checking participant list against previous lists to determine which and how many are repeat victims

̶M̶i̶n̶i̶o̶n̶   Assistant Qualifications:
• familiarity with forum and snapshot navigation
• attention to detail (like, near-obsessive attention to detail)
• ability to count
• high tolerance for boring, repetitive tasks
• love for list-making and data collection/collation
• willingness to communicate via real-world email (so I can send you the super top-secret Bruce image file)
• ability to keep secrets

Potential Rewards:
• sneak previews of Bruce images
• being on the inside of one of the coolest player-created group projects around
• permanent placement on the “Possibly Less Annoying than Most People” list
• occasional displays of my undying gratitude and other melodramatic outbursts
• possible involvement in future attempts to take over the world

Interested? Don't miss this unique opportunity! Reply below, or contact me in-game via IM or mail message. No previous  ̶m̶i̶n̶i̶o̶n̶  assistant experience required! Although that would be a plus. As would the ability to laugh convincingly at my jokes.

Love,
Siren, ̶M̶a̶s̶t̶e̶r̶   Totally Non-Hierarchical Facilitator of Bruce Ceremonies"

But I'm finding that some of the resources are expensive to get, and I don't have the skills or the skill space (at the moment) to be able to make everything myself. In addition, there are only the three community machine rooms, and in the last couple of days I've depleted the fuel in the woodworking machines of two of them. :|;; It's also a huge pain moving around between the three, especially when I get there and find that they're still out of fuel.

What I'm looking for, I guess, is people who have woodworking machines they're willing to loan the use of, with or without my farming the ingredients for fuel cells. I'm perfectly willing to do that. Otherwise I've got stuff available I could trade as payment, namely crops, but I'm also willing to just run around and farm resources.

Alternatively, I guess I could just farm resources and sell them all and buy furniture and wall segments and stuff from other people, but in that case why did I learn all these skills? XD Surely other people have similar problems to this, considering how complicated furnituremaking seems to be in terms of skills."

The only reason I say this could now be one of the most rarest items is, I have never seen anyone post this for sale. It's been like 6-12 months since the change has occurred, and I would imagine that by now, the majority of the Glitch community has sold or used these retired kind.

Humbaba appeared to me several days ago and told me that the world as we know it is going to end. I've never been particularly devout, but this has changed the short life I have left. When I donned the robes of her adherents, she was so pleased that she imagined my face into one whose features are those of her creatures.

I have set all my animals free, but there is one final project I must complete before our days are at an end. I must build a shrine to Humbaba, to thank her for her compassion and for all the animals of Ur. Thus, I am seeking emblems and icons of Humbaba, including any rare or unusual items that pay homage to her. Please, contact me however you wish with what you have to offer and for how much, and we can arrange the transaction.

So the SB-1 is what's left for sale! Let me know if you want it, I'll be on every day until the close.

--------------------------------

So I heard only participants in the recentest feat got these as a prize! 
That sounds pretty sad for everyone else who didn't want to or couldn't. 

I don't have any particular attachment to these boxes, I was never terribly interested in getting them, and I probably don't want them as much as some other people do. 

I'll be taking the next few days to accept requests to HEAR or HOLD these items. I will be finalizing the sale on Sunday mid or late afternoon assuming someone wants to buy it and is available then. If you want to try to hold it, catch me while I'm on or send me a MAIL message (not a butler message but actual mail so I can see it from the website) to discuss timing.

No conditions for hearing it, just come to me and ask.
To hold it, there is a condition. I don't know you all, so I don't know if you'll just run off with it. For this reason, I request that to hold these items we do a trade in which you ""let me hold"" one of your rares while you hold mine. Then, when you're happy and satisfied, we switch right back :)
Items I will accept as collateral: 
-Any artifact that takes more than two pieces to put together
-Any of the beaded necklaces
-A GNG if you want to hold one of the other boxes
-A Rook cubimal
-A defective chick cubimal
-Anything more rare than these will also be acceptable, but if you have those you probably have one of these too! ;)

Now, on to the bidding! 
For those of you who want to not just hold, but have these lovely items, I will accept offers in currants, beaded necklaces, and artifacts (excluding Spork, Necklace, Nose because I have those).
I seem to be the first selling these so I'm not sure how high it might get. For this reason, please do not bid unless you are willing to wait until some time Sunday Nov. 25th to finalize the purchase! 
You can bid any time between now and then, but you will not get it until then and I need all bidders to accept that as a fact, please.
Also, if you want to make an offer please make it in some form of saveable writing, such as here or a note or a mail message (not butler-mail) because I will forget who said what, otherwise. I just need to be able to put a name to the amount and have it saved somewhere :)"

I am desperately looking for a Yeti as the game comes to a close. After days of selling many things I own, I am nowhere near the 7 million currants of the lowest asking price of an adorable imported Yeti. Which yeti is not important; if I could buy one, I would, but I cannot, so I will put out an offer.

1. 4 million currants
2. Antique Spigot
3. Rube Potato
4. Completed Spork
5. Completed Magical Pendant

And if none of those items tickle your fancy, I can also offer up my funpickle (beta item). I would prefer not to part with any other artifacts yet but I will if I have to (all viewable first floor of my tower)! In any case, if you have a yeti that you're willing to part with/send to a temporary new home, please let me know! *wibbles*

Thank you!

3708,30241page120121213031736070582.html,/profiles/PHFAQB5VH4D2OSK/,EDITED: Thank you all so very much,"Hi there;

you might know me! I was in GoC, Spades, PBMS, Cubimal Traders, #!$%, and a number of other groups, even though I mostly avoided Global. I badged, a lot! I nearly got every badge that I could have, since I joined during the Open Beta. But there's a few I won't ever get. You can see my page on Glitchium.com - I really tried to explore every edge of this game.

So, in the last 24 hours, I decided to make a run for the Artifact Badges, since I knew I'd never make it to 60, or become Monarch of the Seven Kingdoms. There's been an incredible outpouring of support and encouragement from many of my good friends here, and from community members I'd never met before today. I'm really, truly grateful :)

I've completed 9 Artifacts, super quickly, and collected pieces #1, #4 and #5 of the Large Mysterious Cube. But I haven't come across #2 or #3 - I haven't even -seen- a #3, anywhere. If these pieces are out there, please help me find them. I've got handfuls of various Artifact pieces to offer, rare cubis, a bit of material wealth or perhaps just chitchat. I do also have A Piece of Street Creator Dirt Trophy #1 (Shovel Point), back from my first month of play.

Finishing the Large Mysterious Cube and becoming a Qualified Artifactologist would make my time here complete. Drop me a line!"
